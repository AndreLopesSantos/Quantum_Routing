# Quantum_Routing

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a routing algorithm for Garbage Trucks that leverages that advantages of Quantum Computing. 
The Quantum computer used is the one provided by [Dwave](https://www.dwavesys.com/ "DWave's Homepage").

## Installing 
(At the moment, there are only nistall instructions for windows)

To run this code, first of all you need to create a virtual enviroment using Python 3:

''' 
python -m venv ocean

'''

### Dwave

To install Dwave on the new-ly created virtual enviroment, please follow the instructions in this video:

### SCIP - Solving Constraint Integer Programs

[SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/ "SCIP's Homepage") is the classical solver that is used to solve the optimization equation using a classical computer. A client for windows can be downloaded [here](https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#download "SCIP's Download page")
